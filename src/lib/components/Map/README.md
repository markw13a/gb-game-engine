Should export Map component which supports:
    - Rendering a limited section of a tile map
    - Rendering a character in that map
    - Moving within the map

In future, it should support:
    - Interacting with objects placed on the map
    - Rendering of NPCs
    - Custom key bindings

Currently have a Map component which is somewhat coupled with app-specific logic. Will work on extracting it at a later date.
